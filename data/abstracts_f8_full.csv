Nevertheless, it is vital to focus on the security issues and the tradeoff between privacy preserving and traceability. A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient's sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient's health information (PHI).

Method: Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned to receive 3 months training versus care-as-usual. Cognitive and mental health were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: Results show significant cognitive improvements across time in the training, but not control, group. This effect was mediated through a combination of increased social activity, improved self-competence, and maintained personal identity strength. Indirect effects on mental health outcomes via these processes were also observed.

Older adults, however, are often hesitant to use SNSs and are reluctant adopters of modern communication media. This results in an asymmetric condition, where younger and older adults use different media and communication channels. To balance communication practices we integrated classic media based on pen and paper with online social networks. In this paper we present a 36 weeks deployment study with an extended family (n=12) of the use of Tlatosketch, a hybrid system based on a digital photo frame, and digital pen and paper technology. This combination allows older adults to stay updated on Facebook and to post paper notes to Facebook.

We obtained three types of evidence. The results show differential patterns of Web 2.0 tool use in relation to age, sex and educational level. Users reported benefits in relation to autonomy, motivation, social dimension, social participation, mood, self-esteem, and physical and mental health generally, and differences were observed according to age, educational level and type of tool. We also obtained differential psychological profiles for users of different tools that could determine usage patterns and derived benefits.

As a counter to this view, we examine the practices of older adult bloggers (N=20) through in-depth interviews. We study this group of older adults as a unique case of content creation and sharing. We find that the practice of creating and sharing through blogging meets several important psychological and social needs for older adults. Specifically, blogging supports the development of identity in older adulthood; fosters selfexpression that supports older adults' values; provides meaningful engagement during retirement; and enables a sense of community and social interaction that is important for wellbeing in late-life.

Monitoring systems were installed in 22 assisted living units to track the activities of daily living (ADLs) and key alert conditions of residents (15 of whom were nonmemory care residents). Activity reports and alert notifications were sent to professional caregivers who provided care to residents participating in the study. Diagnostic use of the monitoring data was assessed. Nonmemory care residents were surveyed and assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) instrument. Pre- and post-installation SWLS scores were compared. Older adult participants accepted monitoring. The results suggest that monitoring technologies could provide care coordination tools that are accepted by residents and may have a positive impact on their quality of life. © 2006 IEEE.,short,"Alwan M., Dalal S., Mack D., Kell S.W., Turner B., Leachtenauer J., Felder R.",Article,2-s2.0-30744448637,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-30744448637&doi=10.1109%2fTITB.2005.855552&partnerID=40&md5=5f37774062a38119b7e48aae1ee2095f,Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine,0-U,0,Impact of monitoring technology in assisted living: Outcome pilot,2006,,

The first concerns the different conceptions of old age held by the cyber-participants and the nonparticipants, and in particular, differing views on learning capacity in later life. The second is related to the varying conceptions of time in old age, and orientation to the past or to the future.
